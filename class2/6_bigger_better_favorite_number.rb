# Write a program that asks for a personâ€™s favorite number. Have your program
# add 1 to the number, and then suggest the result as a bigger and better
# favorite number. (Do be tactful about it, though.)

better_n = n + 1
percent_better = ((better_n - n)/n)

puts "Hey, you know what, I think that #{better_n} is way better than your puny, pathetic little number"
